    *This module is not distributed with the Nginx source.* See the
        installation instructions.

STATUS
    This module is still under initial development. Not usable yet.

SYNOPSIS

    location /foo {
        redis2_query set one first;
        redis2_pass 127.0.0.1:6379;
    }

    location /bar {
        redis2_raw_literal_query '*3\r\n$3\r\nset\r\n$3\r\none\r\n$5\r\nfirst\r\n';
        redis2_pass 127.0.0.1:6379;
    }

    # GET /baz?get%20foo%0d%0a
    location /baz {
        set_unescape_uri $query $query_string;
        redis2_raw_query $query;
        redis2_pass 127.0.0.1:6379;
    }

Installation
    1. Grab the nginx source code from nginx.net (<http://nginx.net/>), for
        example, the version 0.8.54 (see nginx compatibility),

    2. and then build the source with this module:

        $ wget 'http://sysoev.ru/nginx/nginx-0.8.54.tar.gz'
        $ tar -xzvf nginx-0.8.54.tar.gz
        $ cd nginx-0.8.54/

        # Here we assume you would install you nginx under /opt/nginx/.
        $ ./configure --prefix=/opt/nginx \
            --add-module=/path/to/redis2-nginx-module

        $ make -j2
        $ make install

    Download the latest version of the release tarball of this module from
    redis2-nginx-module file list
    (<http://github.com/agentzh/redis2-nginx-module/downloads>).

Compatibility
    The following versions of Nginx should work with this module:

    *   0.8.x >= 0.8.54

    Earlier versions of Nginx will *not* work.

    If you find that any particular version of Nginx above 0.8.54 does not
    work with this module, please consider reporting a bug.

Report Bugs
    Although a lot of effort has been put into testing and code tuning,
    there must be some serious bugs lurking somewhere in this module. So
    whenever you are bitten by any quirks, please don't hesitate to
